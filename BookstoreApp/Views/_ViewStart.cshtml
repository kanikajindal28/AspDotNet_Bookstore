@{
    Layout = "_Layout";
}
@*this file is executed before executing any of the views and is common to all the views
if we want any other layout in any specific view we can overwrite this layout file by null or any other layout file.*@

@*We can create a _ViewStart file at a folder level also which will be executed before all the view files in that folder*@
